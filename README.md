# OdysseyG9-Webcheck
A simple python script which will check the Samsung website for the Samsung Odyssey G9 monitor and pop up a message to alert you there's a firmware update

To use the script, make a folder somewhere on your computer where the script will update text files.
Pass the path to automationRoot and outputFile.

To automate the script to run, use the task scheduler and use "Start a Program" for the action.
Once you reach Program/Script section, pass the path to your python executable:
Example:
"C:\Users\Curry-Master\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe"

Under Arguments, pass the path of your python script:
Example:
"C:\Users\Curry-Master\PythonScripts\Completed Scripts\G9WebCheck.py"

For the time of when you want it to run, personal preference, I just do it on PC bootup.
